# checkers-python-v2
##### A Python based checkers game that runs in the command line

My first attempt at Object Oriented Programming.

For best results, running the main.py in powershell is recommended.

##### Instructions:
No external libraries are required for this program, and no virtual environment is required.
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `python main.py`

The game asks a player for a turn, and after receiving the move start and move end coordinates, a new boardstate is rendered onto the screen.
