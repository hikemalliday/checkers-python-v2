WHERE WE LEFT OFF:
    -Tested the .py file, seems to work except the special '♛' char doesnt work in command line
TODO:
    -Change '♛' to 'K'
    -I left a bunch of commented out 'refactoring' that i deemed unworthy ('process_valid_jumps()')
    -All 'SCORE' stuff has been commented out for the time being
BUGS:
